## Hardware Configuration

### Device Driver API
MicroAuto primarly uses the device configuration of Micromanager.

In some cases some external decives can be configured to work directly with MicroAuto [here](ASawefasd) as long as the device drivers are fully implemented.

## Software Configuration

### Setting up a new User
Users are optional settings that can be used to change the location of the saved data. This is useful for separating data collected by different individuals on the same machine.

### Setting up the location of the root data folder
Adjusting the location of the root data folder is an easy method of enabling the saving of acquisition data to a remote repository.
